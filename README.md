# CesiumDemo

IMPORTANT
Due to the Angular Cesium bindings calling a deprecated function no longer packaged with Cesium,
this project will not function properly offline -- the globe won't render.
I am working on a fix to the bindings, but do not expect this project to work fully as advertised until
the bindings are fixed.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.

To get this project working:
    1.  npm install
    2.  ng build --aot --prod (if I haven't already)

To run this project:
    1.  cd api/
    2. python3 main.py
    3.  open localhost:5000 on your browser
